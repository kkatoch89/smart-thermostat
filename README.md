Purpose of project: Front End for smart home thermostat

Successfully implemented functions:
-The user should be able to access the  thermostat UI from both mobile and web.
-The user should be able to register their thermostat with our home automation backend.
-When users close their session/browser and open it again, they need to have access to their thermostat that was registered in B (donâ€™t account for a case when a user decides to clear all local browser data)
-The user should be able to see the current temperature inside the room.
-The user should be able to switch the thermostat off.
-The user should be able to switch the thermostat to heating mode.
-The user should be able to switch the thermostat to cooling mode.
-Dial color change based on thermostat mode (heat: orange, cool: blue)

Functions still to be worked on:
-Make mobile friendly
-Vertical hover effect on live chart indicating data points of all 3 plotted lines at specific point

Note:
Thermostat dial was used from reenz/react-thermostat repo
